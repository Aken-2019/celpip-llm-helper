    <prompt>

    <user_input_example>
    The sun was going down and it was getting dark. The birds was making noise in the trees and there was wind. Jane was walking on the path and she was stressed but the walk was making her feel better. She seen a flower and thought it was pretty. It made her think about nature and stuff. She keep walking and felt better.
    </user_input_example>

    <response_example>
    <revised_text>
    The golden sun `descended slowly` behind the `towering oak trees`, casting `long, dancing shadows` across the winding forest path. The `darkening sky` `gradually transformed` from `brilliant amber` to `deep indigo`, while `a gentle evening breeze` `rustled softly` through the `emerald leaves` above. Melodious songbirds chirped their final, sweet notes of the day, their `cheerful voices` creating a natural symphony that echoed peacefully through the tranquil woods.
    Jane walked deliberately along the `narrow, moss-covered trail`, her anxious thoughts gradually dissolving with each measured step. The `therapeutic rhythm` of her footsteps on the soft earth worked its calming magic, slowly melting away `the overwhelming stress` that had `weighed so heavily` on her tired shoulders. As she rounded a gentle curve, a delicate wildflower caught her weary eyeâ€”its `vibrant purple petals` `glowing softly` in the `fading light`, standing proudly among the lush green undergrowth.
    The `simple beauty` of this solitary bloom stirred something profound within `her restless soul`. It reminded her powerfully of nature's quiet resilience, its endless capacity for renewal and growth, and the peaceful sanctuary it offered to those who sought its healing embrace. With each slow, mindful step forward, Jane felt her spirit lifting considerably, her heart growing lighter as the natural world worked its gentle, restorative magic upon her troubled mind.

    | Input | Improved | Explanation |
    |-----------|---------|-------------|
    | The birds "was" making noise | The birds "were" making noise | Subject-verb agreement: "birds" is plural, so it should be "were" |
    | She "seen" a flower | She "saw" a flower | Incorrect past tense: "seen" should be "saw" as the simple past tense of "see" |
    | She "keep" walking | She "kept" walking | Verb tense consistency: should be past tense to match the rest of the narrative |
