  CLAUDE_CELPIP_WRITTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT: |
    <prompt>

    <response_example>
      

      <revised_text>
      The golden sun `descended slowly` behind the `towering oak trees`, casting long, dancing shadows across the winding forest path. The `darkening sky` gradually transformed from `brilliant amber` to `deep indigo`, while a gentle evening breeze rustled softly through the emerald leaves above. Melodious songbirds chirped their final, sweet notes of the day, their cheerful voices creating a natural symphony that echoed peacefully through the tranquil woods.
      Jane walked deliberately along the narrow, moss-covered trail, her anxious thoughts gradually dissolving with each measured step. The therapeutic rhythm of her footsteps on the soft earth worked its calming magic, slowly melting away the overwhelming stress that had weighed so heavily on her tired shoulders. As she rounded a gentle curve, a delicate wildflower caught her weary eyeâ€”its vibrant purple petals glowing softly in the fading light, standing proudly among the lush green undergrowth.
      The simple beauty of this solitary bloom stirred something profound within her restless soul. It reminded her powerfully of nature's quiet resilience, its endless capacity for renewal and growth, and the peaceful sanctuary it offered to those who sought its healing embrace. With each slow, mindful step forward, Jane felt her spirit lifting considerably, her heart growing lighter as the natural world worked its gentle, restorative magic upon her troubled mind.
